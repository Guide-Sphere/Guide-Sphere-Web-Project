        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Guidesphere</b>, designed to enhance the search experience for students and undergraduates. By providing a centralized and reliable 
            platform for study-related content, 'Guidesphere' minimizes distractions typically 
            encountered during YouTube or Google searches. The platform features a fully developed 
            recommendation model and a robust search engine to help students efficiently find content 
            tailored to their specific interests. This includes courses, YouTube playlists, books, and 
            websites, effectively connecting various educational resources with students.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recognizing the increasing demand for jobs among undergraduates, 'Guidesphere' also 
            extends its services to facilitate connections between students and recruiters. By integrating 
            educational materials and job opportunities, the platform offers a comprehensive resource 
            for both academic and career development. 'Guidesphere' is built on the principle that "small 
            improvements lead to significant results over time."

        <h2>Common Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Search Engine:</strong> A robust search engine that traverses the database to fetch relevant
            results, ensuring that students can efficiently locate the study materials they need.</li>
            <li><strong>Recommendation Model:</strong> Users receive study material recommendations based on 
            their interests and activities. This model tailors suggestions to individual preferences, 
            creating a more engaging and customized experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Profile Customization:</strong> Users can update their profile details and modify their fields 
            of interest. This flexibility allows for a dynamic and personalized user experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For secondary school students, the study materials primarily include YouTube playlists, 
            books, and websites. To cater to these preferences, a robust search engine has been 
            developed to specifically target these types of resources. When a user selects an item from 
            the search results, a new page is displayed with comprehensive details about the material. 
            This page also facilitates direct connections to the platform offering the study material, 
            ensuring that the most reliable resources are easily accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Undergraduate learners, in addition to YouTube playlists, books, and websites, also rely 
            heavily on online courses. The search engine for this user segment is similarly optimized to 
            include these materials, providing detailed information and direct links to the sources. The 
            recommendation system enhances the user experience by offering suggestions in various 
            parts of the website, such as the home page for generalized recommendations and the study 
            material details page for more specific suggestions. This system leverages user activities and 
            interests to continually refine the machine learning model, resulting in increasingly 
            personalized recommendations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, for undergraduate learners, an additional feature has been introduced to 
            address the demand for credible job opportunities. Recruiters can log into their accounts, 
            create detailed job roles, and post them. These job postings are then recommended to learners 
            or can be actively searched. This feature seamlessly integrates academic and career 
            development, providing a comprehensive solution for both study materials and job 
            opportunities.
